# Introduction

This blog post looks at different aspects of mental health during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic has been and continues to be a great source of anxiety, depression, and general negative feelings for individuals, given the need for quarantine, social distancing, and a general departure from normal, everyday life pre-pandemic. It is important to examine the impact of the pandemic on mental health and explore anxiety and depression in the U.S. during this time in different ways--this will help us understand and respond to the pandemic as a country. Our main takeaway from our Shiny App project was the strong correlation between anxiety and depression, so we wanted to examine that further in our blog post. In this blog post, we examine symptom severity of anxiety and depression in different demographic groups, most common sentiments and words used in tweets about Covid 19, and [KAREN]. 

## Data

Dataset 1: CDC Anxiety/Depression Surveys

- Link: [Links](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/health-care-access-and-mental-health.htm)
- We use data from the household “pulse polls” that were created by the CDC and the U.S. Census Bureau in the early stages of the pandemic in the US, starting on April 23. We focused on the “Anxiety and Depression” survey, which asked four questions about the frequency of depressive/anxious emotions in the past seven days.
- The data was broken down into different categories, including race, gender, age group, and education level. By examining the quantitative values associated with anxiety and depression from the survey, we can explore the ways that depressive/anxious symptoms change across different demographic groups.
- On their website, the CDC notes that this survey uses data collected in a somewhat unconventional manner, given the short duration between data collection and data analysis. Examples of limitations in this survey are inaccurate responses, inability to cover certain households based on contact information, people who were unwilling to respond, and processing errors.
- Despite these limitations, this data is still extremely valuable in providing firsthand accounts of what living through this Pandemic is like. We can get a picture of these past few months because of the instantaneous technology. The benefits of this are even greater for the CDC, U.S. Census Bureau, and any other organizations that need this data to quickly adapt to the challenges proposed by this pandemic.


Dataset 2: Covid-19 Tweets

- Link: [Links](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid19-tweets)
- Description: This is a dataset from kaggle called “COVID19 Tweets” that came in the format of a .csv file. It contains all tweets from 07/24/20 through 08/30/20 that used the hashtag #covid19. They were pulled using Twitter API and a Python script. The dataset contains the following information: user name, location, other variables about the user (i.e., their description, number of followers, favorites, etc.), date of the tweet, full text tweet, hashtags, source, and whether or not it is a retweet.


# Results

[Shiny App for K-Means Clustering](https://avatillman.shinyapps.io/kmeans_app/)

Let's clean up the format of that output:

{r pretty, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```{r}
## GENERAL WORD CLOUD

# read in data for general word cloud
covid_words <- read_csv("/Users/avatillman/git/Blog-Theory-of-Mind/text analysis/covid_words.csv")

pal <- brewer.pal(8, "Dark2") # define color palette for word cloud

set.seed(2) # set seed for reproducibility

# create word cloud
covid_words %>%
  with(wordcloud(words = word, freq = n,
                 max.words = 50, random.order = F,
                 colors = pal,
                 scale = c(3, 1), rot.per = 0.2,
                 family = "sans"))
```

```{r pretty, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
summary(cars) %>%
  kable(col.names = c("Speed", "Distance")
        , row.names = F) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped"
                , full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = T, underline = T) %>%
  column_spec(1:2, width = "1.5in") 
```

In a study from the 1920s, fifty cars were used to see how the speed of the car and the distance taken to stop were related.  Speeds ranged between `r min(cars$speed)` and `r max(cars$speed)` mph.  Distances taken to stop ranged between `r min(cars$dist)` and `r max(cars$dist)` feet, with the middle 50% falling between `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[2])` and `r as.numeric(quantile(cars$dist)[4])` feet.  

You can also embed plots as normal, for example:

```{r figure1, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Speed of car (mph)"
       , y = "Distance taken to stop (ft)"
       , title = "cars data (1920s)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
